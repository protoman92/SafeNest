/// This data type attempts to provide a JSON-like structure by allowing
/// dynamic data to be stored and accessed. We can feed different types of
/// objects (e.g. dicts and arrays) and access nested properties with a string
/// key (joined by path separator). For e.g.:
///
/// safeNest.value(at: "a.b.c.d"
/// safeNest.update(value: 1, at: "a.b.c.d")
///
/// For updating, the nest will create new sub-nests along the way if there is
/// none. That means for path "a.b.c.d", if the value found at "a.b" has no
/// property "c", we create a default dict and set it to "a.b.c".
///
/// For now, only several data types are supported, namely dicts and arrays.
/// This should suffice for most situations, however.
